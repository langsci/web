<h3>Aims and Scope</h3>
<p>The aim of the proposed series is to enhance comparative-historical studies and linguistic reconstruction of proto-languages of the groups and families within Niger-Congo, and eventually, of Proto-Niger-Congo itself. The monographs in this series may be authored by one person or by a team of specialists. They will deal with all aspects of comparative-historical Niger-Congo studies, including both segmental and prosodic phonology, morphology and syntax, etymological dictionaries of groups and families, problems of genetic classification, application of statistical methods to the comparative-historical Niger-Congo studies, correlation of genetic relationships, contact-induced affinities, and so on.</p>
