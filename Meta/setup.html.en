<title>LangSci Press: Setup</title>
 

<!--#include virtual="langsci-header.html"-->



<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>
This page describes the setup of the initiative. It is an elaboration and concrete implementation of <a href="http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/oa-jlm.html">M체ller, 2012</a>. See also <a href="http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/lsp-dfg.html">M체ller and Haspelmath, 2013</a>. 

<h2>Software and Infrastructure</h2>

<p>
We will use <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp">Open Monograph Press</a> (OMP) by
the <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca">Public Knowldege Project</a> (PKP) as software for editorial work
and for providing the catalog of our books. The software and the files for the books will be hosted
by the Freie Universit채t Berlin. The FU is a large university
with <a href="http://www.fu-berlin.de/universitaet/leitbegriffe/zahlen/">app. 28,750
  students</a> (05.12.2013) and has a highly professional team that takes care of the <a href="http://www.zedat.fu-berlin.de/Home">computing infrastructure</a>. 

<h2>Quality Control</h2>

<p>
The <a href="board.html">Advisory Board</a> decides upon <a href="series.html">series
  proposals</a>. Authors can submit their manuscripts through OMP to a certain series. Each
  manuscript will be reviewed by at least two reviewers determined by the series
  editors. See <a href="vision.html#community">Community Effort</a> for future plans.

<h2>Publication Languages</h2>

<p>
In principle we are open to publications in all languages. However, series editors can restrict the
languages in which they accept submissions.

<h2>Publication Formats, Imprint and Citation</h2>

<p>
Books will be provided as PDFs and later also
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book">e-books</a> and HTML (see <a href="vision.html#formats">formats</a>). Since e-books adapt the text
to the size of the display of the reader, there are no citeable page numbers. Hence we will number
paragraphs. Those can be cited independent of the medium.
<p>
Our publications will be cited as follows:
<p>
M체ller, Max, 2015. <EM>A Grammar of Modern Sanskrit</EM>. Empirically Oriented Theoretical
Morphosyntax,  No. 2145, Berlin: Language Science Press.
<p>
The books will be offered in our OMP catalogue. PDFs will be free and there will be links to Print
On Demand services that offer good quality books for an affordable price. Books will also be
distributed via amazon unless the author explicitly refrains from this option. 

 

<h2>Typesetting</h2>

<p>
We accept submissions in <a href="http://de.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> or MicroSoft Word but
strongly prefer <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> submissions. We will provide <a href="latex-styles.html"><span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> templates</a> that ensure that complex
typographical elements like trees, attribute value matrices, and OT tableaux are typeset
correctly. Initial submissions have to be in PDF format.
<p>
<a href="word-to-latex.html">Word to <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> conversion</a> is the most expensive part of our way to
produce books, so authors can help this project by <a href="https://github.com/langsci/latex/blob/master/Guidelines/lsp-guidelines.pdf?raw=true">learning <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span></a>. It will improve their workflow
and the quality of their work.
<p>
See <a href="vision.html#formats">Formats</a> on further plans for producing XML and other formats.



<h2>Storage, Catalogizing, Maintenance</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.ub.fu-berlin.de/">FU Library</a> takes care of catalogizing the books that
we produce and provides <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isbn">ISBN</a>s
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a>s. The books will be
stored on the document server of the FU, which is in the long term backup system and the safety of
the data is guaranteed. In addition our library transfers copies of the files to
the <a href="http://www.dnb.de">German National Library</a>, which also is responsible for long term
archiving.
